My name is Sihao Wang, English name is Benny. I come from China. I am studying this program because I am interested in computer code and using a lot of software. In the future I would like to work in a computer related field. This is the video of my apartment.

# week 2

homework 1

homework 2
The video I intend to make is a horror theme, I will be adding scary and spooky music, eerie breathing sounds as well as footsteps into my video. I plan to shoot in first person so that the viewer feels like they are a spectator as I move around the room with my cell phone and show the viewer what they want to see. I will show the story from the beginning of the blackout to the mysterious things that happen later on through the speed of the pace and changes in lighting.


# week 3:

homework 1
I made this video by hiring someone to shoot some video of me in-house, I filmed in my apartment and I edited in some of the hobbies I like to play such as painting and using some camera equipment. I had my friend control the lighting changes and then shot a lot of video clips that I could link together and tried to play some scary music to complete my draft.
