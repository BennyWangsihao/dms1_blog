Week7 
homework 1
I would like to build a game with a mainframe theme, I will be looking for mesh shapes that resemble the heat dissipation of a computer mainframe, graphics card shapes, wires, and fan shapes, as well as spark particle effects to recreate the feeling of a computer shorting out. Also I would like to create a game in first person view, I will be looking for a human-like model with squeaks for music effects.![alt text](<../static/wo1s1/Mainframe Architecture..jpg>)I think I need a computer model.

homework 2
I simply want to use a rectangle for the case and some other rectangles for the hard drives inside but they need to be tweaked.

week8
homework 1
I downloaded a 3d model of a chassis and split these up in the software 3dmax and copied some maybe 6-7 for use in my game. I used the shape of a hard drive mainframe instead of the rectangle I was using before, the model I was looking for in the first level I added sword shaped guardrails and an air ventilator similar to the one on top of the chassis, I also added some rainbow colored transparent tubes to simulate the wires inside the computer. I also added an interactive rectangle for some gameplay, a guardrail to protect the player from falling, a holey plate to make the game look more like a chassis, I pinched the interior through mesh collision, and I learned how to add particles online to make the computer feel like it's shorting out.![alt text](<Weixin Image_2025-05-18_200936_927.png>)

homework 2
I added current squeaks in the first half because my first two scenes were in a broken chassis, and I chose to add soothing music for my 34th scene to give a sense of escape.

I gave this game to my girlfriend to play and I realized that on the third level she didn't know where to go, I didn't design the level with hints to allow the player to drag the squares to step on them, I think I need to add something to give hints.
