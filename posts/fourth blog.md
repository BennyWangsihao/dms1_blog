homework 1
asignment 1
1. How did you approach the relationship between the sound and visual components of the edit?
I made a short horror movie, I usually add some scary music when a horror event is about to happen, and I added the sound of electricity and the kind of creepy footsteps throughout the movie, so as to create a scary atmosphere.

2. How do you decide on the material you use to shape the project 
I film various things in my home at night at different angles for different lengths of time to see which is best for editing into the video screen, and then turn it up to 1.5x to control the time duration, and watch the tail end of the previous video and re-shoot it if it doesn't connect.

3. What have you learned about the power of sound to shape emotional experiences and how do you apply this knowledge to your projects?
Sound has an incredible ability to channel emotions. Even simple ambient tones can make a visual feel nostalgic, tense or serene. I use layered audio to change the viewer's emotional state - from calm introspection to quiet revelation - to match the storyline I want to tell.

4. How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how do you use these concepts to shape your use of time on a project?
The speed of the editing indicates whether the story is coming to a climax or not, I started with a slow pace until the lights went out and then sped it up, I edited a stop motion animation like climax to tell the story to the scariest part. I did a similar

5. What parts of your personality, interests, past and potential future did you choose to portray in your portrait?
I expressed my home gamepad, blocks and paintings, I wanted to represent the feeling of waking up from a nightmare but continuing to work, my telegraph screen where I was editing a video, and I also showed some of my past paintings and the environment of my home.

6. What are your main aesthetic choices to express these ideas in your work?
I use the tone of a horror story to reveal my interests, which is more likely to get the viewer to look in. I wanted to express the strange things that happen in my home but reveal that I like photography games and drawing, it's more interesting to give people the impression that they are watching a story rather than a mechanized clip of my life.

Assignment 2 - Graphic Icon Reflections 
1. How would you summarize the idea behind this icon set and why did you choose this theme?
My icon suite represents the connection of various human activities and systems centered on leisure, discovery, and personal expression. I chose this theme because I look at my phone every day and some of the system icons on top of my phone gave me this inspiration.

2. Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed in those iterations and why did you choose the one you ended up with?
Yes, I explored several approaches - from highly abstract symbols to detailed character scenes. Early versions lacked cohesion, so I focused on simplifying the graphics and using consistent shapes and gestures. The final version struck a balance between clarity and expression, using minimalist sketch-like characters and bold movements to convey energy and meaning.

3. How did you translate the thumbnail sketch into the final graphic design in Illustrator? What was lost or gained in that translation?
The thumbnail sketches act as structural guides to help me explore movement and pose. In Illustrator, I optimize these forms with clean lines and geometry. The spontaneity of some of the sketches is lost, but the design gains consistency, legibility, and bold visual impact, which is important for icon functionality.

4. How do you use color to create a sense of unity and visual interest in your icons? Why did you choose THE PALETTE? 
I used a cohesive ternary color palette of dark navy, cyan blue and vibrant yellow. The dark background helps to highlight the lighter characters, while the yellow highlights add rhythm and focus. This color palette creates visual unity while evoking a fun, energetic, and digitally friendly atmosphere.

5. How do the sound elements and principles you use in audio design correspond to the design elements and principles you use in visual design?
Just as sound design uses rhythm, layering and contrast, I apply similar principles to visuals. Movement is expressed through pose and shape, while emphasis is created through repetition and color contrast (e.g., yellow accents). Both disciplines use time and harmony to engage the viewer emotionally and intellectually.

6. How did you translate your chosen prompts from an abstract idea into a concrete set of visuals?
I started with the abstract idea of “fun activities” and then broke it down into subcategories of exploration, creativity, performance and service. I identified actions that represented these themes (e.g. far enough to discover music or DJ music) and translated them into simplified iconic scenes. The result is a set of visual metaphors that are approachable and easy to interpret.

homework 2
I thought I would include these questions and answers to show some of the details of my work, and I wanted to include a beginning and an end to summarize what I have learned this semester, first of all I tend to design a futuristic work, these futuristic designs look cool and more in line with the aesthetics of the future people to accept, I usually use which bright blue with black and some mechanical entities such as my third assignment of the In terms of editing videos, I like to edit horror videos because they are more appealing and memorable than the warm one.

week 11
homework 1
![alt text](wo1s1/111.png)
I used black as a theme and added something like a chat box to enter the Q&A status, I left some places blank to add my work, I started with a regular arrangement but that was not creative so my first assignment was later changed to a crisscrossed arrangement and due to the iconography of the second assignment, I added some circles to facilitate the insertion of the images when the time came!

homework 2
![alt text](222.png)
I ended up importing my assignment and changing a colour to make this assignment more in line with the colours of my design work, I also designed a logo for the cover to express what digital media is all about. I also wanted to include a paragraph about myself as my personal designer.
