# Week 4
homework 1
![black square](<../static/1/Benny blacksquare (2).png>)
This week, I dove into Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the Illustrator 2025 Essential Training series. These chapters laid a strong foundation by covering the Illustrator interface, basic shape creation, the use of the selection tools, and key shortcuts. Some key skills I picked up and applied included:

Using the Rectangle Tool (M) to quickly block out compositions.
Align tools to perfectly center elements in my layout.
Pathfinder features to combine and subtract shapes—super handy for making abstract forms.

I used these tools during the Black Square Activity, which tasked me with creating visual interpretations of abstract concepts (like “order,” “conflict,” and “play”) using only black squares. This challenge really forced me to focus on composition, spacing, and balance, all core elements of visual communication.

Design Thinking Reflections
I approached the Black Square Activity using a design thinking mindset. Here's how it broke down:

Empathize: Though the user isn’t obvious, I imagined an audience needing to quickly grasp abstract ideas visually.

Define: Each concept had to be expressed clearly without words—just shapes.

Ideate: I rapidly sketched several compositions for each concept before choosing the strongest.

Prototype: I built the compositions in Illustrator, experimenting with alignment, grouping, and shape modification.

Test/Reflect: I evaluated each composition for clarity—would someone unfamiliar with the project understand the intended concept?

This exercise helped sharpen my sensitivity to how small changes in layout can communicate vastly different meanings.

Assignment 2 Prompt Selection
After reviewing the prompts in the Assignment 2 brief, the one that caught my attention most was:

Design a set of icons that communicates safety information in a playful but clear way.

I like the contrast here—balancing serious content (safety) with a light tone (playfulness). It opens up creative opportunities for color, shape, and style experimentation, while still requiring clear communication.

# week 5

homework 1

I have designed the following color schemes, I think the colors about the software in these schemes are more suitable for solid colors because it has more of a technological feel to it, but the little man is in order to highlight what they are doing I think clashing colors are more suitable for their color schemes.
